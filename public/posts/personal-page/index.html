<p>While I was working on my small macOS app called Exposure Adjustor I forgot that to upload it to the App Store I have to provide a Support URL and Marketing URL. Till now it wasn&rsquo;t a problem all of the apps that I&rsquo;ve published were done for big companies that already had a website. The app allows you to lock the exposure of your camera to make sure that your face is visible even if there is direct sun or window behind you.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-1"> </h3>
<p>I decided to take this opportunity and create a personal CV page you can check it here <a href="https://rogowski.page">rogowski.page</a>, where I can also link and publish my articles (I&rsquo;m not writing too often but it&rsquo;s nice to have your personal space till now I was only publishing on dev.to). I decided to share my experience because with static site generator frameworks it&rsquo;s cheap and easy to do it in one day.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-2"> </h3>
<h2 id="when">When</h2>
<p>I bought a domain on <a href="http://www.ovh.com">www.ovh.com</a> they have this nice plan where you can buy a domain with a <strong>free</strong> hosting included it&rsquo;s called Start10M solution and is described <a href="https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/hosting/activate-start10m/">here</a>. As they are writing on their page</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-3"> </h3>
<p><em>With Start10M, OVHcloud gives you a 10MB Web Hosting plan, and an email account with 5GB storage.</em></p>
<h3 id="nbsp-4"> </h3>
<p>So the only cost is the cost of the domain itself.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-5"> </h3>
<p>Because of the hosting plan limitations, I decided that the only way to go is to use a static site generator framework. I previously used some frameworks like <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">https://www.11ty.dev</a> and integrated it with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">GitLab Pages</a> but  I like to try new technologies so this time I used <a href="https://gohugo.io">https://gohugo.io</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-6"> </h3>
<p>The searched through some themes but finally, I decided to use <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/almeida-cv/">https://themes.gohugo.io/almeida-cv/</a>. It&rsquo;s a clean nice looking CV format page but the thing that I&rsquo;ve missed on it is to list my articles nicely.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-7"> </h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to add the navigation header on top because it would destroy the CV paper feeling that I liked, so I decided to list the last 5 articles that I&rsquo;ve written. I also did some fixes to the layout especially on mobile devices, in my opinion, the CV look is less important than readability so it looks there differently.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-8"> </h3>
<p>To upload the page to the server I&rsquo;m using the open-source <a href="https://cyberduck.io">cyberduck</a> app and it&rsquo;s great and easy to use.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-9"> </h3>
<h2 id="then">Then</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great way to improve your personal branding because you can put much more information on the web page than in an actual CV. I will update you on statistics in the future, I linked this page in my LinkedIn account, Twitter account and in dev.to.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-10"> </h3>
<p>For sure I still have to improve some UI issues but as something that I was able to do during one weekend because my kid was with his grandparents I think it&rsquo;s worth it, and it doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of maintenance.</p>
