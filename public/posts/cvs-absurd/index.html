            <p>One of the responsibilities I have as an Engineering Manager in YouGov is being also a hiring manager for my team. I&rsquo;m responsible for the process because I care to find a correct balance between skills &amp; the need for more engineers (<a href="https://jobs.yougov.com">Open Positions</a>).</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve read a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/">thread</a> about a software engineer who got tired of getting rejected by automated screeners and filled their CV with absurd information they got a 90% call back rate from companies like Reddit, AirTable, Dropbox, Bolt, Robinhood, and others I was like</p>

<h3 id="reality-check">Reality check</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about these tools before, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of how strict the rules are to get a good score.
I liked my CV because I got positive feedback about it from different recruiters which actually read it, so I&rsquo;ve put my CV into the free evaluating tool available <a href="https://resumeworded.com/">online</a>, and my CV&rsquo;s initial score was 23/100 ðŸ˜±!</p>

<h3 id="nbsp-4">Â </h3>
<p>So I assume I wouldn&rsquo;t receive a call from any company that is using the screening tool - which sucks. After spending 15 minutes and making some quick fixes (mostly structure) I re-tested my CV and my score was 67.</p>

<h3 id="nbsp-6">Â </h3>
<p>Now I have to focus on the impact section and I can probably go much higher without lying -but I liked the CV before changes more.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-7">Â </h3>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<p>We all want to reduce bias in our recruitment process - me too.
Automating stuff seems like a really good idea because algorithms are not biased, except the process still is. People which know about the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) vs people which don&rsquo;t and are not aware of how relevant it is.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-8">Â </h3>
<p>What would be great is to be more transparent with candidates and if they were rejected because their CV didn&rsquo;t go through the automation we should just tell them that. We can even provide automated feedback to them, the same as some companies do with automated tasks &amp; assignments. But transparency should be a Two-Way street, and if you plan to lie in your CV please don&rsquo;t, the company will find out anyway through assignment or interview but everyone will waste their time already.</p>
<h3 id="nbsp-9">Â </h3>
<p>So if you didn&rsquo;t hear back from the big company you would love to work for don&rsquo;t worry maybe just tweak your CV :).</p>
