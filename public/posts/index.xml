      <description>I saw a lot of articles why Sign In With Apple (SIWA) is - great, easy etc. Only few of them were showing how difficult it may be and this is one of those. I will list all articles that I found about other problems at the end of the article. I described it from iOS perspective.

      <description>When I stared my journey as an iOS Developer, it was super easy to find things to learn - to be honest it was hard to find things I knew and I felt confident about. Nonetheless after a year or two there came a dangerous moment of routine: my level of knowledge let me do my job and give a phoney ðŸ˜± feeling of being a professional.
Luckily for me a wake-up call came when I was talking with some other iOS Developer and he started to talk about things that I should be familiar with - but I didnâ€™t have a clue what he was talking about.</description>
