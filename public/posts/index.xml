Till now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem all of the apps that I&amp;rsquo;ve published were done for big companies that already had a website legal notes etc. The Exposure Adjustor allows you to lock the exposure of your camera to make sure that your face is visible even if there is direct sun or window behind you.</description>

      <description>When I stared my journey as an iOS Developer, it was super easy to find things to learn - to be honest it was hard to find things I knew and I felt confident about.
