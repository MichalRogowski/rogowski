      <description>One of the responsibilities I have as an Engineering Manager in YouGov is being also a hiring manager for my team. I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for the process because I care to find a correct balance between skills &amp;amp; the need for more engineers (Open Positions).

      <description>Given While I was working on my macOS app Exposure Adjustor. I forgot that in order to upload it to the App Store I have to provide a Support URL, Marketing URL and Privacy Policy URL. Till now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem all of the apps that I&amp;rsquo;ve published were done for big companies that already had a website legal notes etc. The Exposure Adjustor allows you to lock the exposure of your camera to make sure that your face is visible even if there is direct sun or window behind you.</description>

      <description>I saw a lot of articles why Sign In With Apple (SIWA) is - great, easy etc. Only few of them were showing how difficult it may be and this is one of those. I will list all articles that I found about other problems at the end of the article. I described it from iOS perspective.

      <description>When I stared my journey as an iOS Developer, it was super easy to find things to learn - to be honest it was hard to find things I knew and I felt confident about.
