Profile: I spend most of my free time on personal growth. I love to explore new technologies, processes and ways of managing people. I created and published a Mac app for controlling the camera exposure, a side project which is a video analytic framework based on machine learning and a AWS based backend. I can adapt myself to changing circumstances and navigate teams accordingly. I use data to eliminate assumptions and that excites me. I listen to a lot of podcasts but The COACHING for LEADERS is the one I strongly recommend to every manager I work with.

    Positions:
      - Title: Engineering Manager
        Date: March 2020 - Present
        Details: I own technical solutions and delivery within my team. Recently we delivered one of the biggest project in YouGov’s history and our team was the crucial part of it - I was responsible for architecting solutions, manage my team and communicating with CTO’s of other sub-companies to make sure that we are aligned and we will meet all business requirements. I make sure we achieve our roadmap on time and advice the team on finding a balance between technology and business needs. I was co-creating and rolling out career ladder for our engineers, organising remote internal conference, automating our onboarding, and improving performance review processes. I make sure technology strategy meets product development. I track the carrier progress of 13 individual engineers from my team, helping them grow and achieve success through weekly one-on-one meetings. One of the achievements I am most proud of is making the inclusive design part of our designing and development process across the company.

The feedback was very positive. I was also responsible for coordinating the collaboration between iOS, Android and backend teams. Unfortunately, operations in Poland were closed and my contract terminated.
