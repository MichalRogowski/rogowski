Profile: I spend most of my free time on personal growth. Currently, I’m developing a side project which is a video analytic framework based on machine learning - I have a basic understanding of artificial neural networks. I am also writing posts on my blog. I am a team player, I see my success in the success of others, I can adapt myself to changing circumstances and navigate teams accordingly. I love data-driven culture and I’m a big fan of the COACHING for LEADERS podcast.


Experience:
  - Employer: YouGov (https://today.yougov.com)
    Place: Poland/UK/US
    Positions:
      - Title: Engineering Manager
        Date: March 2020 - Present
        Details: I am owning technical solutions and delivery within my team. I make sure we achieve our roadmap on time and advice the team on finding a balance between technology and business needs. I was co-creating and rolling out career ladder for our engineers, organising remote YouGov Dev-summit, making our hackathons more innovative, automating our onboarding, and improving performance review processes. I make sure technology strategy meets product development. Next thing is to track the carrier progress of 13 individual engineers from my team, helping them grow and achieve success through weekly one-on-one meetings. One of the achievements I am most proud of is making the inclusive design part of our designing and development process across the company.

        Details: I lead all technical aspects of the mobile team. I was responsible for uniting my team with a common goal for example by bi-weekly one-on-ones. I collaborated with our product manager based in London to map all business requirements into functional apps. During this period we published redesigned iOS and Android apps for our users. Rating of those apps improved by 2.6 stars since then.

        Date: Oct 2018 - Mar 2019
        Details: I supervised the work of the iOS team. My primary goal was to meet the deadline for our main products. One of them was a replacement app for the "old" application that has supported hundreds of thousands of paying users. We finished in time and we were in open Beta for 10 000 users. The feedback was very positive. I was also responsible for coordinating the collaboration between iOS, Android and backend teams. Unfortunately, operations in Poland were closed and my contract terminated.
