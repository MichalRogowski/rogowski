## Given
While I was working on my small macOS app called Exposure Adjustor I forgot that to upload it to the App Store I have to provide a Support URL and Marketing URL. Till now it wasn't a problem all of the apps that I've published were done for big companies that already had a website. The app allows you to lock the exposure of your camera to make sure that your face is visible even if there is direct sun or window behind you.
### &nbsp; 
I decided to take this opportunity and create a personal CV page you can check it here [rogowski.page](https://rogowski.page), where I can also link and publish my articles (I'm not writing too often but it's nice to have your personal space till now I was only publishing on dev.to). I decided to share my experience because with static site generator frameworks it's cheap and easy to do it in one day.
### &nbsp; 
## When
I bought a domain on www.ovh.com they have this nice plan where you can buy a domain with a **free** hosting included it's called Start10M solution and is described [here](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/hosting/activate-start10m/). As they are writing on their page 
### &nbsp; 
*With Start10M, OVHcloud gives you a 10MB Web Hosting plan, and an email account with 5GB storage.*
### &nbsp; 
So the only cost is the cost of the domain itself. 
### &nbsp; 
Because of the hosting plan limitations, I decided that the only way to go is to use a static site generator framework. I previously used some frameworks like https://www.11ty.dev and integrated it with [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) but  I like to try new technologies so this time I used https://gohugo.io.
### &nbsp; 
The searched through some themes but finally, I decided to use https://themes.gohugo.io/almeida-cv/. It's a clean nice looking CV format page but the thing that I've missed on it is to list my articles nicely.
### &nbsp; 
I didn't want to add the navigation header on top because it would destroy the CV paper feeling that I liked, so I decided to list the last 5 articles that I've written. I also did some fixes to the layout especially on mobile devices, in my opinion, the CV look is less important than readability so it looks there differently.
### &nbsp; 
To upload the page to the server I'm using the open-source [cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) app and it's great and easy to use. 
### &nbsp; 
## Then
I think it's a great way to improve your personal branding because you can put much more information on the web page than in an actual CV. I will update you on statistics in the future, I linked this page in my LinkedIn account, Twitter account and in dev.to.
### &nbsp; 
For sure I still have to improve some UI issues but as something that I was able to do during one weekend because my kid was with his grandparents I think it's worth it, and it doesn't require a lot of maintenance.
